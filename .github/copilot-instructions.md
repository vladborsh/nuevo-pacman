# Project Context

This is a modern reimagining of the classic Pac-Man game, built using TypeScript and HTML5 Canvas. The project aims to create a full game experience without using any external assets - all graphics and sounds are generated programmatically.

## Key Technical Requirements

1. Use HTML5 Canvas for all rendering
2. Generate all graphics programmatically (no external sprites)
3. Use Web Audio API for sound effects and music
4. Implement grid-based movement and collision detection
5. Create AI pathfinding for enemies
6. Store high scores using local storage

## Code Style Guidelines

- Use TypeScript's strict mode
- Implement proper encapsulation using private fields
- Use interfaces for type definitions
- Follow object-oriented programming principles
- Use requestAnimationFrame for the game loop
- Implement the Observer pattern for game events
